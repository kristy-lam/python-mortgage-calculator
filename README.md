# Python Mortgage Calculator

This programme helps users to calculate their monthly mortgage repayment. Users will be asked to choose the mortage type applicable to their situation (i.e. repayment or interest only), then to input the house value, down payment paid and interest rate (and years of paying back the mortgage for the repayment option).

Users' inputs will always be validated. If an invalid input is detected, they will be asked to provide an appropriate one before they can move on to the next part with the use of functions, try except, if loops and while loops.
